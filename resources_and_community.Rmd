We work openly and collaboratively with [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/download), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## How we learned 

We saw what was possible and learned using the following resources, which are all available online for free, and developed and used by a welcoming community. These lists are by no means exhaustive! 

- [**Resources for learning R and open data science tools**](http://ohi-science.org/news/Resources-for-R-and-Data-Science)

- [**References about the importance of open data science tools in science**](http://ohi-science.org/news/importance-of-open-data-science-tools)

## Join the community

We are passionate about building the environmental data science community. 

In addition to the [training materials we developed for the Ocean Health Index](http://ohi-science.org/training/), we started [eco-data-science](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) at the University of California at Santa Barbara, which is a [skill-sharing and community-building Study Group](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups/join).
