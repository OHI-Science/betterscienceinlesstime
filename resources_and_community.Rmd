## Resources

[**These resources**](http://ohi-science.org/news/Resources-for-R-and-Data-Science) helped us learn R and other open data science practices and tools. They are developed and used by a welcoming, inclusive community, and are all available online for free. 

[**These references**](http://ohi-science.org/news/importance-of-open-data-science-tools) in the academic literature and media discuss the importance of open data science tools in science.
