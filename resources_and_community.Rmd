We work and code openly and collaboratively with R, RStudio, git, and GitHub. 
We learned using the following resources, which are all available online for free. They have been created the awesome open data science community, and you should learn with a community too. 

**Community Calls** <!---https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues--->

We will host community calls to share stories bridging environmental science and data science.
