[**These resources**](http://ohi-science.org/news/Resources-for-R-and-Data-Science) helped us learn R and other open data science practices and tools. They are developed and used by a welcoming, inclusive community, and are all available online for free. 

[**These references**](http://ohi-science.org/news/importance-of-open-data-science-tools) in the academic literature and media discuss the importance of open data science tools in science.

Here are some suggestions to use these resources and learn in an intentional way:

## Let's build the environmental data science community

We are passionate about building the environmental data science community. 

In addition to the [training materials we developed for the Ocean Health Index](http://ohi-science.org/training/), we started [eco-data-science](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) at the University of California at Santa Barbara, which is a [skill-sharing and community-building Study Group](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups/join).

And we're also on Twitter:
