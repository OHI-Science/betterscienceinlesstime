We are marine scientists using open data science tools to help understand ocean health all over the world.

For the past four years, our team at the Ocean Health Index has dramatically improved the way we do science by embracing data science and open science â€” we code collaboratively and openly share our work online. As a result, our work is more reproducible and streamlined, and more than 20 countries around the world are building off our science and code to assess ocean health in their own jurisdictions. 

We're sharing our story because at the time we thought this transformation was intimidating, but we are living proof that it's possible, and we want to encourage others to do the same. Here are ways to learn more about our story:

<font size="2">**Figure 1. Better science in less time, illustrated by the Ocean Health Index project.** Every year since 2012 we have repeated Ocean Health Index (OHI) methods to track change in global ocean health. Increased reproducibility and collaboration has reduced the amount of time required to repeat methods (size of bubbles) with updated data annually, allowing us to focus on improving methods each year (biggest innovations written as text). The original assessment in 2012 focused solely on scientific methods (e.g., obtaining and analyzing data; developing models; calculating and presenting results (dark shading)). In 2013, by necessity we gave more focus to data science (e.g., data organisation and wrangling; coding; versioning; documentation (light shading)), using open data science tools. We established `R` as the main language for all data preparation and modeling (using RStudio), which drastically decreased the time involved to complete the assessment. In 2014, we adopted Git and GitHub for version control, project management, and collaboration. This further decreased the time required to repeat the assessment. We also created the OHI Toolbox, which includes our `R` package `ohicore` for core analytical operations used in all OHI assessments. In subsequent years we have continued (and plan to continue) this trajectory towards better science in less time by improving code with principles of tidy data; standardising file and data structure; and focusing more on communication, in part by creating websites with the same open data science tools and workflow.
