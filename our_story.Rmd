We are marine scientists, and we are using open data science tools to help understand ocean health all over the world.

Science-based environmental decision-making relies on collaborating across social and scientific disciplines, and working transparently and reproducibly. For the past four years, our team at the Ocean Health Index has improved the way we do science by embracing data science and open science â€” we code collaboratively and openly share our work online. As a result, our work is more reproducible and streamlined, and more than 20 countries around the world are building off our science and code to assess ocean health in their own jurisdictions. 

We're sharing our story because at the time we thought this transformation was intimidating, but we are living proof that it's possible. We want to encourage others to also embrace open data science practices and tools, so we can all do better science in less time.
