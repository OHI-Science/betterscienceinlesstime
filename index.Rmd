_Better Science in Less Time_ is more reproducible, transparent, collaborative open, and communicated well.  

We are marine scientists who also code. In the past five years, within the Ocean Health Index context, we have dramatically improved the way we collaborate, combine marine science and programming, and develop scientific tools for coastal management. The [story](link to story page) of how we were able to achieve better science more efficiently, and thus in less time, is told in this new paper in Nature.

Through sharing our journey, we would like to connect with other scientists in the [Open Science community](link to resources and community page), share resources, and learn together!
